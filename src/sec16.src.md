# tfe5 source files

## How to compile and execute the text editor 'tfe'.

First, source files are shown in the later subsections.
How to download them is written at the end of the [previous section](sec15.src.md).

The following is the instruction of compilation and execution.

- You need meson and ninja.
- Set environment variables if necessary.
If you have installed gtk4 from the source and you preferred the option `--prefix $HOME/local` (see [Section 2](sec2.src.md)), type `. env.sh` to set the environment variables.

~~~
$ . env.sh
~~~
- change your current directory to `src/tfe5` directory.
- type `meson _build` for configuration.
- type `ninja -C _build` for compilation.
Then the application `tfe` is built under the `_build` directory.
- type `_build/tfe` to execute it.

Then the window appears.
There are four buttons, `New`, `Open`, `Save` and `Close`.

- Click on `Open` button, then a FileChooserDialog appears.
Choose a file in the list and click on `Open` button.
Then the file is read and a new Notebook Page appears.
- Edit the file and click on `Save` button, then the text is saved to the original file.
- Click `Close`, then the Notebook Page disappears.
- Click `Close` again, then the `Untitled` Notebook Page disappears and at the same time the application quits.

This is a very simple editor.
It is a good practice for you to add more features.
